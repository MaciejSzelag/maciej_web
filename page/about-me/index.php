                    <p>If you're here it means you want to find out more about me.</p>
                    <p>Ok let's see what I can do for you. I am a Polish boy living in Plymouth, UK. I came to England
                        in 2015. I am not going to come back because I fell in love with this beautiful country. </p>
                    <p>But it is not the most important issue. </p>
                    <p>Let's focus on something more important.</p>
                    <p>I started my first steps with programming in the Polish Army when I was a soldier. I learned most of the basic information. When I left the Polish Army, I worked for Manley based in Warsaw.</p>
                    <p>What I do as a freelancer? Of course I create websites always with CMS (Content Management System),
                        good page speed and of course with RWD (Responsive Web Design).</p>
                    <p>I also care about the security and comfort of my Clients. </p>
                    <p>To keep high standards I constantly improve myself. Every day I learn somthing new or improve my
                        knowladge.</p>
                <p>I focus on originality and passion. I always listen my clients' ideas and I create their vision.</p>
                    <p>Quality, responsability, time and creativity are priority for me because I know I work very hard
                        for my good name.</p>
                    <p>I will help, advice and I will take any subject what you present. </p>
                    <p>My <a href="../price/">prices</a> are very elastic. I am open for any sugestions and bold ideas. </p>
