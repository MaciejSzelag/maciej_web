                <p>CMS is computer software or an application that uses a database to manage all content, and it can be used when developing a website. A CMS can therefore be used to update content and/or your website structure.</p>
                <p>With a CMS, you can create, manage, modify, and publish content in a user-friendly interface. You can customize the design and functionality of your site by downloading or purchasing templates and extensions, rather than coding. You can have multiple users working in the back-end of the same tool â€” and much more.</p>
